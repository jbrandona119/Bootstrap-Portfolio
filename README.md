About Me Portfolio with Bootstrap   

Description

This is supposed to be a very close copy of the first portfolio we made with CSS but instead of CSS we used
Bootstrap 4. 



Support
If this doesn't look right it's because I am terrible at Bootstrap.


Roadmap
Hopefullly within the next few months I can get better with bootstrap and make it look more uniform.
Until then it is going to look broken and ugly.

Contributing
Please, fix my site if you feel so inclined to do so.
